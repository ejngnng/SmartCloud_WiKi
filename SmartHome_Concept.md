## Group functions
|id|Function	|Parameters	|Base Item	|Description|
|:--|:-----------|:--------------|:------------|:---------|
|1|**EQUALITY**|-	| all	|Sets the state of the members if all have equal state. Otherwise UNDEF is set.|
|2|**AND, OR, NAND, NOR**|	,|	all (must match active & passive state)	|Sets the <activeState>, if the member state <activeState> evaluates to true under the boolean term. Otherwise the <passiveState> is set.|
|3|**SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX**|	-	| Number	|Sets the state according to the arithmetic function over all member states.|
|4|**COUNT**|	| Number |	Sets the state to the number of members matching the given regular expression with their states.|

### Examples for derived states on group items when declared in the item DSL

* Group:Number:COUNT(".*") counts all members of the group matching the given regular expression, here any character or state (simply count all members).
* Group:Number:AVG calculates the average value over all member states which can be interpreted as DecimalTypes.
* Group:Switch:OR(ON,OFF) sets the group state to ON if any of its members has the state ON, OFF if all are off.
* Group:Switch:AND(ON,OFF) sets the group state to ON if all of its members have the state ON, OFF if any of the group members has a different state than ON



#Things


## Thing Status
|id|Status	|Description|
|:---|:----------|:----------|
|1|**UNINITIALIZED**	|This is the initial status of a thing, when it is added or the framework is being started. This status is also assigned, if the initializing process failed or the binding is not available. Commands, which are sent to channels will not be processed.|
|2|**INITIALIZING**	|This state is assigned while the binding initializes the thing. It depends on the binding how long the initializing process takes. Commands, which are sent to channels will not be processed.|
|3|**UNKNOWN**|The handler is fully initialized but due to the nature of the represented device/service it cannot really tell yet whether the thing is ONLINE or OFFLINE. Therefore the thing potentially might be working correctly already and may or may not process commands. But the framework is allowed to send commands, because some radio-based devices may go ONLINE if a command is sent to them. The handler should take care to switch the thing to ONLINE or OFFLINE as soon as possible.|
|4|**ONLINE**	|The device/service represented by a thing is assumed to be working correctly and can process commands.|
|5|**OFFLINE**|The device/service represented by a thing is assumed to be not working correctly and may not process commands. But the framework is allowed to send commands, because some radio-based devices may go back to ONLINE, if a command is sent to them.|
|6|**GONE** |	The device has been removed from the bridge or the network to which it belongs and is no longer available for use. The user can now remove the thing from the system.|
|7|**REMOVING** |	The device/service represented by a thing should be removed, but the binding did not confirm the deletion yet. Some bindings need to communicate with the device to unpair it from the system. Thing is probably not working and commands can not be processed.|
|8|**REMOVED**|This status indicates that the device/service represented by a thing was removed from the external system after the REMOVING was initiated by the framework. Usually this status is an intermediate status because the thing gets removed from the database after this status was assigned.|
